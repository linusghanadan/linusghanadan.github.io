According to the EJScreen technical documentation, the PM 2.5 indicator reported in this database gauges potential exposure to particles that are 2.5 micrometers or less. Specifically, the EJScreen database includes data for the annual average concentration in the air, measured in micrograms per cubic meter, at designated locations across the United States.\n\nUnderstanding PM 2.5 concentration is important because this air pollutant has major effects on human health and the environment. Many of these harmful effects are detailed on the EPA website, which is cited in the EJScreen technical documentation. For example, there are serious health effects to the human heart and lungs that can directly result from the inhalation of PM 2.5. In terms of environmental effects, PM 2.5 can be carried long distances by the wind and settle on ground or water, negatively impacting the chemical composition of important ecosystems.\n\nMoreover, the EPA website provides information on major sources of PM 2.5 in the environment. Most PM 2.5 is not emitted directly from a source but instead is formed in the atmosphere following reactions between other pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which are commonly emitted by automobiles, power plants, and industrial processes. Sources of PM 2.5 that are directly emitted into the air generally come from sources such as construction sites, unpaved roads, smokestacks, and fires.\n\nI chose to investigate the spatial link between PM 2.5 and race demographics in my home State of Maryland because I think it has the potential to highlight an example of the environmental disparities faced by people of color. I've heard that Prince George's County, home to my alma mater the University of Maryland, has a great deal of air pollution as a result of being directly downwind of Washington DC. I also know from living in the DC area for over 10 years that this county has many more people of color compared to neighboring Montgomery County, which lies northwest (and thus upwind) of DC. I'm very curious to see whether if there is an environmental justice issue here to highlight and how pronounced this issue might be.\n\n## Setup\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load packages\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Import data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read in gdb of EJScreen data at the Census Block Group level\nejscreen <- st_read(here(\"data\", \"2024-1-10-post-data\", \"EJSCREEN_2023_BG_StatePct_with_AS_CNMI_GU_VI.gdb\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nReading layer `EJSCREEN_StatePctiles_with_AS_CNMI_GU_VI' from data source \n  `/Users/linusghanadan/Documents/MEDS/other/linusghanadan.github.io/data/2024-1-10-post-data/EJSCREEN_2023_BG_StatePct_with_AS_CNMI_GU_VI.gdb' \n  using driver `OpenFileGDB'\nSimple feature collection with 243021 features and 223 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -19951910 ymin: -1617130 xmax: 16259830 ymax: 11554350\nProjected CRS: WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Wrangle data for Maryland and variables being looked at\nejscreen <- ejscreen %>%\n  filter(ST_ABBREV == \"MD\") %>% \n  filter(!is.na(PEOPCOLORPCT)) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(PM25))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Wrangle data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Find the average values for all variables within counties\nmaryland_counties <- aggregate(ejscreen, by = list(ejscreen$CNTY_NAME), FUN = mean) %>%\n  mutate(\"People of Color (%)\" = PEOPCOLORPCT * 100, # Change variable names for plotting\n         \"Mean PM 2.5 (ug/m^3)\" = PM25)\n\n# Filter for PG County\npg_county <- ejscreen %>%\n  filter(CNTY_NAME == \"Prince George's County\") %>% \n    mutate(\"People of Color (%)\" = PEOPCOLORPCT * 100, # Change variable names for plotting\n         \"Mean PM 2.5 (ug/m^3)\" = PM25)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Create visualization for Maryland\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create PM map of Maryland\npm_map <- tm_shape(maryland_counties) +\n  tm_polygons(col = \"Mean PM 2.5 (ug/m^3)\", palette = \"Reds\",\n              breaks = seq(from=6.0, to=8.5, by=0.25)) +\n  tm_compass(type = \"4star\", position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_scale_bar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.height = 0.5)\n\n# Create demographics map of Maryland\ndemographic_map <- tm_shape(maryland_counties) +\n  tm_polygons(col = \"People of Color (%)\", palette = \"Blues\",\n          breaks = seq(from=0, to=100, by=10)) +\n  tm_compass(type = \"4star\", position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_scale_bar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.height = 0.5)\n\n# Stack the maps\ntmap_arrange(pm_map, demographic_map, nrow=2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Create visualization for Prince George's County\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create PM map of PG county\npm_map <- tm_shape(pg_county) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"Mean PM 2.5 (ug/m^3)\", palette = \"Reds\",\n          breaks = seq(from=7.0, to=8.5, by=0.1)) +\n  tm_scale_bar(position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) +\n  tm_compass(type = \"4star\", position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"left\", \"center\"))\n\n# Create demographics map of PG county\ndemographic_map <- tm_shape(pg_county) +\n  tm_fill(col = \"People of Color (%)\", palette = \"Blues\",\n          breaks = seq(from=0, to=100, by=5)) +\n  tm_scale_bar(position = c(\"right\", \"top\")) +\n  tm_compass(type = \"4star\", position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"left\", \"center\"))\n\n# Stack the maps\ntmap_arrange(pm_map, demographic_map, nrow=2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
