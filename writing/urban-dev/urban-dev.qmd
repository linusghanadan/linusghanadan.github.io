For this paper (completed for Culture & Natural Resource Management class at the University of Maryland), I analyzed the sustainability challenges and opportunities for São Paulo, Brazil, within the framework of environmental, economic, and social conditions. I evaluated the city's Ecological Footprint, identified key local environmental issues like soil degradation and air pollution, and assessed the impact of income inequality on sustainable development. I also explored potential policy solutions from the São Paulo Climate Action Plan, which focuses on renewable energy, green infrastructure, and social equity.
