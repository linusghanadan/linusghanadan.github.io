I recently received a Bachelor's degree in 2023 (B.S. in Environmental Economics from the University of Maryland) and a Master's degree in 2024 (M.S. in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara). Moving forward, I am very interested in very interested in using data science to find innovative solutions that deliver a healthy planet.

#### **Highlighted Projects**:

-   [**Time Series Analysis of Nutrient Concentration in Chesapeake Bay**](https://github.com/linusghanadan/chesapeake-bay-nutrient-pollution-python): My favorite data science project from graduate school. For this final project in my masterâ€™s statistics course, I worked independently to find data, pose a question, and carry out analysis using statistical modeling and Python.

-   [**Improving GHG Data Analysis Workflow for an Outdoor Apparel Company**](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-6-20-post/): Provides an overview of my master's capstone project, including screenshots from our customized interactive dashboard. I completed this project alongside Kristen Graf (Director of Environmental and Social Responsibility at Darn Tough Vermont) and fellow students Carly Caswell, Annie Adams, and Flora Hamilton.

-   [**Policy Memo on U.S. Offshore Wind Development**](https://linusghanadan.github.io/writing/offshore-wind/offshore-wind.html): 3-page memo (and accompanying slide-deck) from my internship at the U.S. Department of Transportation. For this project, I conducted market research, synthesized information, and worked cross-functionally to ensure my final deliverables were extremely robust. As a result, I was provided the opportunity to present my findings to leadership in a 30-minute presentation.
