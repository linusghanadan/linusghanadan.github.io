I recently received a Bachelor's degree in 2023 (B.S. in Environmental Economics from the University of Maryland) and a Master's degree in 2024 (M.S. in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School at UC Santa Barbara). Moving forward, I am very interested in using analytics to help with Earth's carbon and biodiversity crises.

#### **Highlighted Projects**:

-   [**Time Series Analysis of Nutrient Concentration in Chesapeake Bay**](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-8-20-post/chesapeake-bay-python.html): See my line-by-line Python code, output, and written analysis for my final project in my master's statistics course. For this project, I worked independently to propose a statistical question, find data, and build and interpret a statistical model.

-   [**Improving GHG Data Analysis Workflow for an Outdoor Apparel Company**](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-6-20-post/): Provides an overview of my master's capstone project, including screenshots from our customized interactive dashboard. I completed this project alongside Kristen Graf (Director of Environmental and Social Responsibility at Darn Tough Vermont) and fellow students Carly Caswell, Annie Adams, and Flora Hamilton.

-   [**Policy Memo on U.S. Offshore Wind Development**](https://linusghanadan.github.io/writing/offshore-wind/offshore-wind.html): 3-page memo (and accompanying slide-deck) from my internship at the U.S. Department of Transportation. For this project, I conducted market research, synthesized information, and worked cross-functionally to ensure my final deliverables were extremely robust. As a result, I was provided the opportunity to present my findings to leadership in a 30-minute presentation.
