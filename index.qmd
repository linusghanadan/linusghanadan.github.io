# About me

I graduated in June 2024 with a M.S. in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. As a Master's capstone project, I worked with the outdoor apparel company Darn Tough Vermont to model and visualize their data on greenhouse gas emissions. In May 2023, I received a B.S. in Environmental Economics from the University of Maryland, and as a student there, I also gained research and internship experience at the U.S. Department of Transportation, World Resources Institute, and The Nature Conservancy.
