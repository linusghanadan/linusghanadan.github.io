# About me

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. I finished my undergraduate studies in 2023, receiving a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Economics from the University of Maryland. While at UMD, I also gained experience working on policies affecting offshore wind energy supply chains at the U.S. Department of Transportation, analyzing transport electrification policies at the World Resources Institute, and researching nature-based carbon sequestration at The Nature Conservancy. Moving forward, my career goal is to implement data-driven solutions that advance sustainability within the public and private sectors.
