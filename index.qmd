In June 2024, I graduated with a Master's in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. I also hold a B.S. in Environmental Economics from the University of Maryland, which I received in May 2023. I am very interested in using data analytics to inform the energy transition.

#### **Highlighted Projects**:

-   [**Time Series Analysis of Nutrient Concentration in Chesapeake Bay (Using Python)**](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-8-20-post/chesapeake-bay-python.html): See my line-by-line code, code output, and written explanations and analysis for my final project in my master's statistics course. For this project, I worked independently to propose the statistical question of how nutrient pollution has changed in the Chesapeake Bay since 2010, as well as find over 43,000 samples to help me answer my question. Then, I used Python to build two (nitrogen and phosphorus) trend analysis models, visualize each model's components, and conduct hypothesis tests to better understand model implications.

-   [**Policy Memo on U.S. Offshore Wind Development**](https://linusghanadan.github.io/writing/offshore-wind/offshore-wind.html): 3-page memo (and accompanying slide-deck) from my internship at the U.S. Department of Transportation. For this project, I conducted market research, synthesized information, and worked cross-functionally to ensure my final deliverables were extremely robust. As a result, I was provided the opportunity to present my findings to leadership in a 30-minute presentation.

-   [**Improving a Workflow for Carbon Accounting and Sustainability Analysis**](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-6-20-post/): Provides an overview of my master's capstone project (including screenshots of deliverables) and my primary contributions. For this project, I worked with three classmates and the outdoor apparel company Darn Tough Vermont.
