# Data Science Portfolio

### Data Visualization

### Final Project for Statistics Class

**Time Series Analysis of Nutrient Concentration in the Chesapeake Bay** \| [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/linusghanadan/chesapeake-bay-nutrient-pollution) \| [Link to Blog](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2023-12-12-post/)

Constructed two Seasonal-Trend using LOESS (STL) decomposition models to conduct 2010-2019 time series analysis of nutrient concentrations in the Chesapeake Bay. Used 43,809 nitrogen samples and 43,590 phosphorus samples from 143 monitoring stations positioned throughout the Bay's tidal regions. Selecting seasonality for the model based on autocorrelation, visualized monthly mean concentration, seasonally adjusted monthly mean, STL seasonality component, and STL trend component for each of the two pollutants. Ran regressions of model parameters to compare the proportion of variation that was attributable to seasonality for nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as to compare 95% confidence intervals for change in each pollutant's trend component over the 10-year period.

### Master's Capstone Project

**Creating and Implementing an Analytical Workflow for an Outdoor Apparel Company’s Carbon Accounting and Sustainability Analysis** | [Link to GitHub Page](https://github.com/carbonSOCKprint) | [Link to Blog](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-6-20-post/)

Worked with the Head of Sustainability at outdoor apparel company Darn Tough Vermont and three classmates to streamline the company's spreadsheet method for calculating and analyzing data on yearly Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions. Built interactive web-application dashboard that allows the company to visualize emissions and conduct scenario analysis based on adjustable input variables (e.g., can evaluate emissions under scenarios with differing fiber procurements).

### Project for Geospatial Analysis Class

**Spatial Analysis of 2021 Houston Power Crisis** | [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/linusghanadan/houston_power_crisis/tree/main) | [Link to Blog](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-1-20-post/)

Used data from NASA’s VIIRS instrument to conduct a spatial analysis of the 2021 Houston Power Crisis. Determined and visualized census tracts in the Houston metropolitan area where residential blackouts occurred and analyzed how this related to median income of census tracts.

### Project for Policy Evaluation Class

**Impact Analysis of a 1998 Cash-Transfer Program in Rural Mexico** | [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/linusghanadan/cash-transfer-policy) | [Link to Blog](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-3-6-post/)

Compared pre-treatment characteristics in the treatment and control groups of the 1998 Prospera cash-transfer program. Estimated the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of the program on a household’s value of owned animals with the First-Difference, Fixed-Effects, and Difference-in-Difference estimators.

### Project for Modeling Environmental Systems Class

**Dynamic Simulation of Forest Growth** | [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/linusghanadan/dynamic-simulation-forest-growth) | [Link to Blog](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-6-10-post/)

Generated stochastic parameter sets for forest size model inputs (exponential growth rate before canopy closure, linear growth rate after canopy closure, carrying capacity, and canopy closure threshold) and used an ordinary differential equations solver to run 300-year continuous dynamic simulations of forests. Conducted global sensitivity analysis (ran 2,000 simulations and computed Sobol indices of input parameters) to look at impact of varying parameter values on maximum forest size.

### Projects for Machine Learning Class

**Cluster Analysis of Bio-Contaminating Algae in the Port Jackson Bay** | [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/linusghanadan/ml-clustering-lab/tree/main) | [Link to Blog](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-4-1-post/)

Implemented K-means clustering algorithm with data on metal contents (Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, and Ni) in two species of co-occurring algae at 10 sample sites around Port Jackson Bay to plot the Total Within Sum of Square (TWSS) for different numbers of clusters and determine the optimal number of clusters that indicate distinct types of bio-contaminating algae. In addition, calculated Euclidean distance matrix to build hierarchical clustering model and inspect the resulting dendrogram for outlier points.

**Regression Models to predict Dissolved Inorganic Carbon in California Coastal Ecosystems** | [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/linusghanadan/dic-ml-models) | [Link to Blog](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-4-3-post/dic-ml-models.html)

Used data from a marine ecosystem research program to build three models (single decision tree, random forest, and stochastic gradient boosted trees) that predict dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) based on other ocean chemistry features (e.g., sulfur trioxide concentration) that were also measured during water sampling. Developed visualizations comparing root mean squared error (RMSE) among the three models and analyzing feature importances in the best performing model.
