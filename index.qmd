# About me

I graduated in June 2024 with a M.S. in Environmental Data Science from the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at UC Santa Barbara. As a Masterâ€™s capstone project, I worked with the outdoor apparel company Darn Tough Vermont to model and visualize their data on greenhouse gas emissions.

In May 2023, I received a B.S. in Environmental Economics from the University of Maryland. As an undergraduate student, I also gained research and internship experience at the U.S. Department of Transportation, World Resources Institute, and The Nature Conservancy.

Moving forward, my career goal is to implement data-driven solutions that advance sustainability within the public and private sectors. The best way to stay up-to-date on my endeavors is to follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linus-ghanadan/), [GitHub](https://github.com/linusghanadan/), and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/linusghanadan/).
