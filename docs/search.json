Then, I create a generalized model that provides total and percent area of suitability for any species based on input ranges of suitable temperature and depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 12, 2023\n\n\nLinus Ghanadan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nBuilding predictive user classification models with data from Spotify Web API\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMachine Learning\n\n\nR\n\n\n\n\nIn this blog post, I build predictive models using a single decision tree, bagged decision trees, a random forest, and Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB) for predicting whether a given song was in my Spotify collection or that of my friend Maxwell. Then, I compare the performance of these four models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 12, 2023\n\n\nLinus Ghanadan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nLand cover analysis around Mount Whitney\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeospatial Analysis\n\n\nLand Cover Analysis\n\n\nPython\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis uses Python to extract land cover statistics from a USGS raster dataset on land cover classification in the area surrounding Mount Whitney in California.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 11, 2023\n\n\nLinus Ghanadan\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

I finished my undergraduate studies in 2023, receiving a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science & Policy from the University of Maryland. While at UMD, I also gained experience working on policies affecting offshore wind energy supply chains at the U.S. Department of Transportation, analyzing transport electrification policies at the World Resources Institute, and researching nature-based carbon sequestration at The Nature Conservancy. Moving forward, my career goal is to implement data-driven solutions that advance sustainability within the public and private sectors."

The simplest way to define the are of interest to look for in the catalog are:\n\na GeoJSON-type dictionary with coordinates of the bounding box\nas a list [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] with the coordinate values definind the four corners of the bounding box.\n\nYou could also use a point, or some more complex polygon.\nIn this lesson we will look for NAIP scenes over Santa Barbara from 2018 to 2020. We’ll use the GeoJSON method: to define the area of interest:\n\n# temporal range of interest\n# CHECK: how to get open/close time ranges\ntime_range = \"2018-01-01/2023-01-01\"\n\n# NCEAS bounding

The simplest way to define the are of interest to look for in the catalog are:\n\na GeoJSON-type dictionary with coordinates of the bounding box\nas a list [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] with the coordinate values definind the four corners of the bounding box.\n\nYou could also use a point, or some more complex polygon.\nIn this lesson we will look for NAIP scenes over Santa Barbara from 2018 to 2020. We’ll use the GeoJSON method: to define the area of interest:\n\n\nCode\n# temporal range of interest\n# CHECK: how to get open/close time ranges\ntime_range = \"2018-01-01/2023-01-01\"\n\n# NCEAS bounding box (as a GeoJSON)\n# NCEAS bounding box (as a GeoJSON)\nbbox = {\n    \"type\": \"Polygon\",\n    \"coordinates\":[\n        [\n            [-119.70608227128903, 34.426300194372274],\n

\nsearch\n\n\n&lt;pystac_client.item_search.ItemSearch at 0x1680d6810&gt;\n\n\nTo get the items found in the search (or check if there were any matches in the search) we use the item_collection() method:\n\n\nCode\nitems = search.item_collection()\n\n# number of items in search\nlen(items)\n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\nCode\nitems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n                \n

In this case, we know that our raster area was a square, which means that extracting the bounding box does not include additional area that was not part of the analysis. Next, we convert these points into a shapely.Polygon, which then allows us to create a geopandas.GeoDataFrame containing this polygon. Lastley, we make another geopandas.GeoDataFrame that just contains a single point for Mount Whitney.

    "text": "Introduction\nThe Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States, and the largest body of water that is regulated under the Clean Water Act (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2023). Federal regulation pertaining to the Bay took decades to implement, and this is in large part because of the Bay’s large size and the many stakeholders involved. In the 1970s, the Bay was identified as one of the first areas in the world to have a marine dead zone, a phenomenon that literally suffocates aquatic life due to lack of oxygen in the water. Despite dead zones being identified in the 1970s, it was not until 2000 that the Bay was designated as an “impaired water” under the Clean Water Act. Then, it took another ten years, until 2010, for the EPA to take the next step of issuing Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements, the regulatory action mandating water quality improvement.\nSpecifically, a TMDL is the maximum amount of a particular pollutant that a body of water can receive and still meet applicable water quality standards (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2023). This maximum amount is calculated in pounds based on measurements taken at areas where pollution is likely to end up in the Bay. In their 2010 regulation, the EPA established TMDL requirements for nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment. Nitrogen and phosphorus, referred to as nutrients because of their role in providing nutrition to many animals and plants, cause algal blooms, which cause marine dead zones through taking in dissolved oxygen and blocking sunlight. Sediment contributes to dead zones by blocking sunlight as well, leading it to also be included in the 2010 TMDL requirements.\nThis analysis will focus on nitrogen and phosphorus, the two pollutants responsible for algal blooms in the Chesapeake Bay. A 2022 study found that agricultural runoff was the largest source of nutrient pollution, accounting for 48% of nitrogen and 27% of phosphorus in the Chesapeake Bay (Chesapeake Progress, n.d.). Both of these pollutants also get to the Bay as a result of urban and suburban runoff, wastewater treatment plants releasing treated water, and natural sources (e.g., runoff from forests, wetlands, etc.). In addition, about 25% of nitrogen that ends up in the Bay comes from air pollution that is originally emitted to the atmosphere by sources such as cars and factories (Burns et al. 2021). Through a process called atmospheric deposition, these nitrogen compounds react with other chemicals to become nitrous oxides, which can be deposited back to Earth’s surface through precipitation or as dry deposition.\nThrough conducting a time series analysis of post-2010 nitrogen and phosphorus concentration measurements, my goal is to better understand how concentrations have changed since the introduction of TMDL requirements. I’m also interested in the nature of any seasonality and whether the three time series components (i.e., seasonal, trend, and random) are consistent across both nitrogen and phosphorus."

While Tier 1 and 2 data can be collected by any interested group, Tier 3 data is collected by monitoring stations overseen by experienced professionals. Only Tier 3 data can be used for governmental regulatory assessments.\nFor my analysis, I will be using 2010 to 2019 Tier 3 data collected at 143 different monitoring stations positioned throughout the Chesapeake Bay tidal regions, which includes the mainstem Bay and tributary components.

Thus, the autocorrelation function provides us with a tool that allows us to better understand any seasonal trends present in our data. This will be useful for us in subsequent steps of our time series analysis.\n\n\nSTL decomposition\nAs a core part of this time series analysis, I’ll be constructing a seasonal trend decomposition using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS), which is often abbreviated as a STL decomposition model. STL allows us to separate our monthly average concentrations into three components: seasonal trend, non-seasonal trend, and remainder. Through plotting these components next to each other, we gain a more intuitive understanding of the underlying forces contributing to variation in our dependent variable, which in this case is the monthly average concentration.\nAs opposed to other decomposition methods, one thing that is particular to STL models is the ability to specify the length of a season. It can be helpful to adjust this input depending on our desired level of smoothing for the non-seasonal trend. We will use our results from the autocorrelation function to inform our chosen length of seasons. The autocorrelation function is useful in this context because it can tell us after how many lags we see a drop-off in correlation, indicating there is a drop in the significance of the seasonal trend."

Meanwhile, the t-4 lag is not statistically significant. The rest of the lags remain the same or slightly decrease when comparing from the first and second year of lags. In the third year, there is a drop off in the t-28 lag compared to t-12, and there continues to be what seems like a marginal decrease in correlation across most lags. Considering all of this, I decided to set the seasonality of my STL model for nitrogen to 24 months.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot autocorrelation function for phosphorus with lags going back three years\nacf(phos_monthly_avgs_ts, lag.max = 36, i = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor phosphorus, there is a very consistent marginal decline for each set of lags over the course of the three years. This is good news for our STL because it means that the seasonal trend will be easier to separate from the non-seasonal trend. Like I did with nitrogen, I’m also going to use two-year seasons for phosphorus. Similar to the case with nitrogen, it seems to me like the drop-off in lag correlations from year two to year three is a bit larger than from year one to year two. This suggests that a two-year seasonal cycle will give us an informative non-seasonal trend component that is neither too eager nor too hesitant to categorize differences as non-seasonal trends.\n\n\nSTL decomposition\n\n\nCode\n# Conduct STL for nitrogen with two-year seasons, and extract components\nnitr_decomp &lt;- nitr_monthly_avgs_ts %&gt;%\n  fabletools::model(feasts::STL(monthly_avg, t.window = 24)) %&gt;% \n  generics::components()\n\n# Plot STL model\nautoplot(nitr_decomp) +\n  labs(title = \"STL model of nitrogen concentration\", x = \"Year Month\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot of the three STL components for nitrogen, it is still difficult to see a long-term trend, despite the line being fairly smooth. There does seem to be a slight downward trend until 2018. From 2018 to 2019, there is a clear increase, but this change is then offset by an equivalent decrease over the course of 2019 to 2020. In addition the grey bars on the left all represent the same range, implying that the remainder components of our STL model contributed the most to variation in nitrogen concentration. However, this seems to be very influenced by the high spike in 2014.\n\n\nCode\n# Conduct STL for phosphorus with two-year seasons, and extract components\nphos_decomp &lt;- phos_monthly_avgs_ts %&gt;%\n  fabletools::model(feasts::STL(monthly_avg, t.window = 24)) %&gt;% \n  generics::components()\n\n# Plot STL model\nautoplot(phos_decomp) +\n  labs(title = \"STL model of phosphorus concentration\", x = \"Year Month\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe STL plot for phosphorus does make it seem like there is a long-term downward trend, but it is difficult to tell how significant it is because of the long grey bar, which indicates it is least influential of the three components in our STL model. In this case, the grey bars show us that seasonality contributes the most to the variation in phosphorus concentration.\n\n\nCode\n# For nitrogen, plot monthly mean, seasonally adjusted monthly mean, STL seasonality, and STL trend\nggplot(nitr_monthly_avgs_df, aes(yr_mo)) +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\", date_minor_breaks = \"6 months\", date_labels = \"%Y-%m\") +\n  geom_line(aes(y=nitr_decomp$monthly_avg, color = \"Monthly mean\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=nitr_decomp$season_adjust, color = \"Seasonally adjusted monthly mean\"), linewidth=2) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=nitr_decomp$trend, color = \"STL trend\"), linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=nitr_decomp$season_year, color = \"STL seasonality\")) +\n  labs(x = 'Year-Month',\n       y = 'Concentration (mg/L)',\n       title = \"Nitrogen in Chesapeake Bay (2010-2019)\") +\n  scale_color_manual(name = \"\", values = c(\"Monthly mean\" = \"black\", \"Seasonally adjusted monthly mean\" = \"cornflowerblue\", \"STL seasonality\" = \"seagreen\", \"STL trend\" = \"red\"), breaks = c(\"Monthly mean\", \"Seasonally adjusted monthly mean\", \"STL seasonality\", \"STL trend\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nI decided to make this visualization to get a better idea of exactly how these components map on to each other. This plot seems to confirm the idea of negligible trend for nitrogen. Since the x-axis is labeled for each year here, it is also easier to see the seasonal trend. Each year, nitrogen concentrations increase sharply around December. They then peak around February to March, before decreasing substantially and reaching their minimum around July.\n\n\nCode\n# For phosphorus, plot monthly mean, seasonally adjusted monthly mean, STL seasonality, and STL trend\nggplot(phos_monthly_avgs_df, aes(yr_mo)) +\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\", date_minor_breaks = \"6 months\", date_labels = \"%Y-%m\") +\n  geom_line(aes(y=phos_decomp$monthly_avg, color = \"Monthly mean\")) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=phos_decomp$season_adjust, color = \"Seasonally adjusted monthly mean\"), linewidth=2) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=phos_decomp$trend, color = \"STL trend\"), linewidth = 2) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=phos_decomp$season_year, color = \"STL seasonality\")) +\n  labs(x = 'Year-Month',\n       y = 'Concentration (mg/L)',\n       title = \"Phosphorus in Chesapeake Bay (2010-2019)\") +\n  scale_color_manual(name = \"\", values = c(\"Monthly mean\" = \"black\", \"Seasonally adjusted monthly mean\" = \"cornflowerblue\", \"STL seasonality\" = \"seagreen\", \"STL trend\" = \"red\"), breaks = c(\"Monthly mean\", \"Seasonally adjusted monthly mean\", \"STL seasonality\", \"STL trend\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\", plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\nOur plot for phosphorus further supports the idea that there is a slight downward trend over the decade. If you independently trace the maximums or minimums, the line does seem to be moving downward at an oscillating but fairly consistent rate. Unlike nitrogen, phosphorus concentrations shoot up in the middle of the year around May, have a relatively flat peak lasting from June to August, and then shoot down at the end of Summer.\n\n\nSimple linear regressions based on STL model parameters\n\nCode\n# Run regression of season component on monthly average nitrogen\nnitr_season_reg &lt;- lm(monthly_avg ~ season_year, data = nitr_decomp)\n\n# Print the formatted regression table\nstargazer(nitr_season_reg, title = \"Regression of monthly nitrogen concentration against seasonal trend component\", align = TRUE, digits = 3, type = 'html', notes.append = FALSE, notes = \"[***]p&lt;0.01\")\n\n\n\n\nRegression of monthly nitrogen concentration against seasonal trend component\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDependent variable:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmonthly_avg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseason_year\n\n\n1.038***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.086)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstant\n\n\n0.898***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(0.010)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations\n\n\n120\n\n\n\n\nR2\n\n\n0.551\n\n\n\n\nAdjusted R2\n\n\n0.547\n\n\n\n\nResidual Std.

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nMy time series analysis suggests that seasonality plays a substantial role in contributing to variation in the monthly mean concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in tidal regions of the Chesapeake Bay. For nitrogen, seasonal trends explained 55% of the variation in monthly means, and the relationship was even stronger for phosphorus, with seasonal trends explaining 76% of the variation. While the seasonal component for nitrogen was highest during Winter, the seasonal component for phosphorus was highest during Summer.\nThis analysis was also interested in any non-seasonal trend that has occurred since the introduction of TMDL requirements in 2010. For both nitrogen and phosphorus, we find evidence at an alpha level of 0.01 that the 10-year change in non-seasonal trend is negative. However, our confidence intervals suggest that, for both nutrient pollutants, these changes in trend represent a less than 1% decrease in concentration over the decade. It was also notable how the non-seasonal trend was much more consistent for phosphorus than nitrogen. This can be seen in our STL visualization and is also reflected by the larger adjusted R-squared for phosphorus (0.56) compared to nitrogen (0.06) computed in the linear regression of non-seasonal trend component against year-month.\nThe main limitation of this analysis was that no form of spatial interpolation was employed to estimate concentrations across the tidal region based on the location of measurements. It would be interesting to compare such an analysis to what we did here, as any significant differences would imply that sampled areas are not spread throughout the region in a representative manner. Further analysis might also investigate what happened at the beginning of 2014 that could have led to the high spike in nitrogen levels at that time, in addition to factors that might have fueled the increase seen over the course of 2018."

    "text": "Oyster suitability analysis\nNow that we have processed the data, we can move on to figuring out where oyster aquaculture is suitable in West Coast EEZs. Oysters generally reside in waters with a sea surface temperature of 11 to 30 degrees Celsius and at a depth of 0 to 70 meters below sea level (Froese and Pauly 2023). Thus, we will use these ranges to build a suitability raster and then crop to only include areas in West Coast EEZs.\n\nCreate and crop suitability mask\n\n\nCode\n# Make binary raster with values of 1 where SST is 11-30 degrees Celsius (otherwise NA)\nrcl = matrix(c(-Inf, 11, NA,\n                 11, 30, 1, \n                 30, Inf, NA), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\nsst_binary &lt;- reclassify(mean_sst, rcl = rcl)\n\n# Make binary raster with values of 1 where depth is 0-70 meters below sea level (otherwise NA)\nrcl = matrix(c(-Inf, 0, NA,\n                 0, 70, 1, \n                 70, Inf, NA), ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)\ndepth_binary &lt;- reclassify(depth, rcl = rcl)\n\n\n# Multiply cell values in both binary rasters to create mask raster of suitable locations for oysters \noyster_mask &lt;- overlay(sst_binary, depth_binary, fun = '*')\n\n# Crop mask based on EEZ data\noyster_mask &lt;- crop(oyster_mask, eez)\n\n\n\n\nCreate cell areas raster and EEZ raster\nNext, we calculate the total number of cells that are suitable. In this case, this is equivalent to the cell areas in meters squared, as the grid cell resolution is one meter by one meter. We also convert the cell areas data and EEZ area data to raster form, so we can perform our calculation in the next step.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate total number of cells that are suitable\ncell_areas &lt;- cellStats(oyster_mask, stat = \"sum\", na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Create raster for cell areas and populate\ncell_areas_raster &lt;- raster(oyster_mask)\ncell_areas_raster[] &lt;- cell_areas\n\n# Convert EEZ data to raster\neez_raster &lt;- rasterize(eez, oyster_mask)\n\n\n\n\nCalculate total and percent suitable area for each EEZ\nTo calculate total and percent suitable area for each EEZ, we use the zonal() function from the raster package in R. This function allows us to calculate the sum of suitable grid cells within each EEZ, as our EEZ raster labels each grid cell as part of one of the five West Coast EEZs.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate total suitable area within each EEZ\ntotal_suitable_area &lt;- raster::zonal(cell_areas_raster, eez_raster, fun = sum, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Calculate percentage of suitable area within each EEZ\npercent_suitable_area &lt;- (total_suitable_area / eez$area_m2) * 100\n\n\n\n\nVisualize results\n\n\nCode\n# Bind EEZ data with total area and percent calculations\neez_joined &lt;- cbind(eez, total_suitable_area, percent_suitable_area) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\"Suitable area (km^2)\" = value / 1000000) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\"Percent suitable\" = value.1) %&gt;% \n  dplyr::select(-value, -value.1, -zone, -zone.1)\n\n# Store polygons for U.S. West Coast States from spData package\nCA &lt;- us_states %&gt;%\n  filter(NAME == \"California\")\nOR &lt;- us_states %&gt;%\n  filter(NAME == \"Oregon\")\nWA &lt;- us_states %&gt;%\n  filter(NAME == \"Washington\")\n\n# Initialize new bbox using EEZ bbox\nbbox_new &lt;- st_bbox(eez)\n\n# Create variable for x range of bbox\nxrange &lt;- bbox_new$xmax - bbox_new$xmin\n\n# Set new x range for bbox\nbbox_new[3] &lt;- bbox_new[3] + (0.9 * xrange)\n\n# Convert bbox to sfc\nbbox_new &lt;- bbox_new %&gt;%\n  st_as_sfc()\n\n# Create plot of total suitable area for oysters in U.S. West Coast EEZs\ntotal_area_map &lt;- \n  tm_shape(eez_joined, bbox = bbox_new) +\n  tm_fill(\"Suitable area (km^2)\", palette=\"Reds\", style = \"equal\", n=6) +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_shape(CA) +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_shape(OR) +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_shape(WA) +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_compass(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_scale_bar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Suitable area for oyster aquaculture\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"center\")) +\n  tm_layout(inner.margins = 0.15)\n\n# Create plot of percent suitable area for oysters in U.S. West Coast EEZs\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\npercent_area_map &lt;- \n  tm_shape(eez_joined, bbox = bbox_new) +\n  tm_fill(\"Percent suitable\", palette=\"BuPu\", style = \"equal\", n=6) +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_shape(CA) +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_shape(OR) +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_shape(WA) +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_compass(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_scale_bar(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\")) +\n  tm_layout(title = \"Suitable area for oyster aquaculture\") +\n  tm_layout(legend.position = c(\"right\", \"center\")) +\n  tm_layout(inner.margins = 0.15)\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\ntmap_arrange(total_area_map, percent_area_map)"

However, unlike oysters who thrive in depths of up to 70 meters below sea level, the Common carp can only handle up to 29 meters. We can apply our generalized function to see what this means in term of how suitability differs for the Common carp.\n\n\nCode\n# Run function for Common carp species\nsuitable_aqua(\"Common carp\", tempmin=3, tempmax=35, depthmin=0, depthmax=29)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two maps are very similar in terms of how the different EEZs compare to each other, but a closer inspection of the legend values does show us that the Common carp has a consistently higher amount of suitable area. Hence, the larger temperature range was more important for suitability than the narrower depth range."

    "section": "Conclusion",
    "text": "Conclusion\nThe main takeaway from this analysis is that we were able to build a model that helps us better understand which West Coast EEZs are best suited for marine aquaculture of certain species based on ideal ranges for sea surface temperature and depth. To demonstrate how this model could be used, this analysis looked at suitability for oysters and the Common carp. Specifically, our comparison showed that having a larger temperature range (3-35 degrees Celsius for carp compared to 11-30 degrees Celsius for oysters) was more important for suitability than having a narrower depth range (0-29 meters for carp compared to 0-70 meters for oysters).\nThis being said, there are certainly limitations in using our model. For one, using a sea surface temperature raster with finer resolution would give us more precise estimates. In addition, this analysis did not look at where marine aquaculture currently exists on the West Coast. This model could be improved upon by subtracting areas that are already being used for marine aquaculture. Lastly, a more robust model would look at more variables than just sea surface temperature and depth. Further analysis might include additional water variables with conditional ranges for different species, such as degree hardness (dH) and potential of hydrogen (pH)."

The group was created following the 1973 oil crisis by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to oversee and collect data on global energy markets. In the last decade, the group has increasingly played an important role in guiding and advocating for an accelerated global energy transition away from fossil fuels (International Energy Agency (IEA) 2024).\nSince 2020, the IEA has published yearly data estimating global methane emissions at a country-level. For methane emissions resulting from oil and gas processes (upstream and downstream), these figures are calculated using a combination of measurement data (mostly from satellite readings) and activity data on the specific actions being taken that release vented, fugitive, or incomplete-flare emissions. Coal mine methane emissions are estimated primarily by looking at the ash content of coal produced in different countries, mine depth, and regulatory oversight. Furthermore, estimating country-level emissions from agriculture and waste mainly relies only satellite technology. Lastly, other methane sources are estimated using manufacturing data and the emissions factors associated with the industrial processes carried out in that country (International Energy Agency (IEA) 2022b).\nI will be using the 2022 data set, which provides emissions estimates for the year 2021 (International Energy Agency (IEA) 2022a). Anyone can access this data set for free after making an account on the IEA website.\nIn addition to the methane data set, I also want data on 2021 population values of different countries for computing emissions per capita, so I downloaded a free data set from the World Bank website, which did not require me to have any sort of account (The World Bank, n.d.)."

    "text": "General data wrangling\nTo start, I have some general data wrangling steps that allowed me to explore the data and calculate some of the statistics that I ended up including in my infographic. In the code chunk below, I’m storing the world-level rows in the IEA data set as their own data frame, and reconfiguring the data frame to find the percent of total global emissions coming from each of the four sectors, which I ended up including in the legend of my first plot.\n\n\nCode\n# store observations regarding entire world as its own df\nworld_df &lt;- methane_df %&gt;%\n  filter(is.na(country)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(country, type) %&gt;% # group by input variables ('type' must be last to combine observations in next line)\n  summarize(total_emissions = sum(emissions, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% # create summary df that combines observations with same 'type'\n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = total_emissions) %&gt;% # create new columns named based on 'type' and containing values from 'total_emissions'\n  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;%\n  mutate(total_emissions = agriculture + energy + waste + other) %&gt;% # re-create 'total_emissions' column\n  select(-country)\n\n# calculate percents of 'total_emissions' coming from each type of emissions (to be put in legend of treemap)\nworld_df$agriculture / world_df$total_emissions\n\n\n[1] 0.2902036\n\n\nCode\nworld_df$energy / world_df$total_emissions\n\n\n[1] 0.545233\n\n\nCode\nworld_df$waste / world_df$total_emissions\n\n\n[1] 0.1446558\n\n\nCode\nworld_df$other / world_df$total_emissions\n\n\n[1] 0.01990765\n\n\nI also perform some general data wrangling on my methane data frame, which will be important moving forward. After removing the world-level rows that I subsetted in the previous code chunk, I’m doing a ‘group_by’ command followed by a ‘summarize’ command to combine observations that are of the same type. Before doing this, there were multiple observations for energy emissions, breaking down into further levels of granularity based on other columns that are not selected here. I’m also combining all countries that are part of the European Union by changing their country names to the same string and then again using the ‘group_by’ and ‘summarize’ commands to combine rows. Lastley, I decided to make a wide form of this same data frame, which will be helpful when we get to plot 2 of my infographic.\n\n\nCode\nmethane_df &lt;- methane_df %&gt;%\n  filter(!(is.na(country))) %&gt;% # remove observations regarding entire world\n  group_by(country, type) %&gt;% # group by input variables ('type' must be last to combine observations in next line)\n  summarize(total_emissions = sum(emissions, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% # create summary df that combines observations with same 'type'\n  ungroup() %&gt;% \n  mutate(country = case_when(country == \"Other EU17 countries\" ~ \"EU*\", # reassign country names for countries in EU so we can combine these observations\n                             country == \"Other EU7 countries\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"France\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"Italy\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"Germany\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"Sweden\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"Norway\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"Poland\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"Denmark\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"Estonia\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"Netherlands\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"Slovenia\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"Romania\" ~ \"EU*\",\n                             country == \"United States\" ~ \"U.S.\", # shorten United States to U.S.\n                             TRUE ~ country)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(type, country) %&gt;% # group by input variables ('country' must be last to combine observations in next line)\n  summarize(total_emissions = sum(total_emissions, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% # combine observations\n  ungroup()\n\n# create wide version of methane_df so that there is one observation for each 'country' (to be used for next graph)\nwide_df &lt;- methane_df %&gt;%\n  filter(!(country == \"Other\")) %&gt;% # remove observations where 'country' is other\n  filter(!(country == \"Other countries in Europe\")) %&gt;% \n  filter(!(country == \"Other countries in Southeast Asia\")) %&gt;% \n  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = total_emissions) %&gt;% # create new columns named based on 'type' and containing values from 'total_emissions'\n  janitor::clean_names() %&gt;% \n  mutate(energy = ifelse(is.na(energy), 0, energy)) %&gt;% # set NA in 'energy' column to 0 so that next line works\n  mutate(total_emissions = energy + agriculture + waste + other) %&gt;%  # re-create 'total_emissions' column\n  arrange(desc(total_emissions))"

I also multiply this new column by 1,000,000 to convert units from million tons to tons, which produces values that are easier to understand when talking about emissions per person.\nNext, I create a new data frame only containing six countries (China, U.S., Russia, Brazil, Canada, and Australia) and the European Union, as I want to focus on the emissions from these places in my infographic. I take the sum of their emissions and populations and compare that to global emissions and populations, and the resulting percent values will also be included on my infographic as text.\n\n\nCode\n# add 'emissions_pc' column and convert column units\nscatter_df &lt;- scatter_df %&gt;% \n  mutate(emissions_pc = (total_emissions / population) * 1000000) %&gt;% # create 'emissions_pc' column (in tons)\n  mutate(population = population / 1000000) %&gt;% # convert 'population' values from people to millions of people\n  arrange(desc(emissions_pc))\n\n# create new data frame with only the 7 countries of focus (including EU)\nmain_countries &lt;- scatter_df %&gt;%\n  filter(country %in% c(\"China\", \"U.S.\", \"Russia\", \"Brazil\", \"EU*\", \"Canada\", \"Australia\")) %&gt;% \n  arrange(desc(total_emissions))\n\n# add 'population' column to world_df\nworld_df &lt;- world_df %&gt;%\n  mutate(population = 7950946801) %&gt;% # found from row 260 in pop_df\n  mutate(population = population / 1000000) # convert 'population' values from people to millions of people\n\n# calculate the percents of global population and global emissions in countries of focus\nsum(main_countries$population, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(world_df$population, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n[1] 0.3287581\n\n\nCode\nsum(main_countries$total_emissions, na.rm = TRUE) / sum(world_df$total_emissions, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n\n[1] 0.4664618\n\n\nAt this point, I just need to get a few more data frames in order to make my scatterplot. I create four new data frames: one for all the countries that I’m not focusing on in my infographic, one for notable countries that I want to include (but not highlight) in my infographic for the sake of comparison, one for just Australia (so I can adjust its label on the plot), and one for the remaining countries of focus. Importantly, I also make a new column that I will use to set the alpha value, which moduates transparency in ggplot, of each point in my scatter plot. I want my countries of focus to not be transparent at all, and the rest of my points to be reasonably transparent. After this, its time to make the scatterplot.\n\n\nCode\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n##                          plot 2 visualization                            ----\n##~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n# create new data frame excluding the countries of focus\nother_countries &lt;- scatter_df %&gt;% \n  filter(!(country %in% c(\"China\", \"U.S.\", \"Russia\", \"Brazil\", \"EU*\", \"Canada\", \"Australia\")))\n\n# create new data frame with countries to label but not highlight (for context)\nother_notable_countries &lt;- other_countries %&gt;% \n  filter(country %in% c(\"India\", \"Indonesia\", \"Iran\", \"Mexico\", \"Congo\", \"Venezuela\", \"Bangladesh\"))\n\n# create new df for just Australia (so can adjust where label is on plot)\naustralia_df &lt;- scatter_df %&gt;% subset(country == \"Australia\")\n\n# create new df for highlighted countries minus Australia (so can plot separately)\nother_main_countries &lt;- main_countries %&gt;% filter(!(country == \"Australia\"))\n\n# add new column for alpha values to scatter_df\nscatter_df$alpha_value &lt;- ifelse(scatter_df$country %in% c(\"China\", \"U.S.\", \"Russia\", \"Brazil\", \"Australia\", \"Canada\", \"EU*\"), 1, 0.2) # only countries of focus have alpha of 1, all else 0.2\n\n# create scatterplot\nggplot(scatter_df) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = population, y = emissions_pc, alpha = alpha_value), color = \"#020122\") + # use alpha values from the column\n  scale_alpha_identity() + # tell ggplot to use the alpha values as given (without scaling)\n  geom_text(data = australia_df, # add text for Australia\n            aes(label = country, x = population -

    "title": "Creating an infographic on anthropogenic methane emissions in 2021",
    "section": "My visualization approach",
    "text": "My visualization approach\nWhen creating my plots in R and then my infographic in Canva, I thought through several aspects that are integral to effective data visualization practice. In this final section, I’ll go through each of these aspects and comment on my approach.\n\nGraphic form\nFor my first plot, I decided to do a treemap because it is a useful way to compare different parts of a ‘whole’, which in this case was total global emissions. Generally, treemaps are a better way to display this than a pie chart, as humans are much worse at understanding relative sizes that are part of a rounded object. In my second plot, I decided on scatterplot because I thought that seeing the distribution of per capita emissions among all countries, with the countries of focus highlighted, would be the easiest way to put understand how these countries compared to others. For my third plot, I made a dodged column plot because it seemed like a simple and effective way to communicate to my audience the nuances of how each of the countries of focus have emissions coming from different types of sources.\n\n\nText\nThis is a broad category, and I made a lot of decisions regarding the text used in my plots. Every word of text that I included was thoughtfully considered. My most major decisions were in my scatterplot, where I included labeled points (not only of focus countries but also other comparison countries), an annotation (for contextualizing emissions data), and a note in my caption to tell the audience directly that there were actually 8 countries with even higher per capita emissions than what was shown within the bounds of the plot.\n\n\nThemes\nI made a great deal of theme adjustments in each of my plots. For the first plot, the main theme choice was to orient my legend the way that I did, at the very top of the plot so the reader would read it immediately. In the second and third plot, I decided to get rid of vertical grid lines but keep some horizontal grid lines to help my audience to more easily see where countries lined up along the y-axis. I also moved the axis titled farther away from the axis in both of these plots, which I think is easier on the eyes.\n\n\nColors\nI made a custom color palette that I thought was unique, aesthetically pleasing, color-blind friendly (checked using the “let’s get color blind” Chrome Extension), and fit the variables that I was representing. I reused the colors from my first plot in my last plot, where they represented the same thing in each. I also reused the dark blue color quite a bit in my infographic, most notabley for shading the highlighted areas in my map and then to highlight these same countries as point in my scatterplot. All of the text that I wrote in Canva was also this color.\n\n\nTypography\nI chose to use Merriweather Sans for the title and captions of my plots and Barlow Condensed to use for all other text within my plots (labeling rectangles in plot 1, labeling points in plot 2, plot 2 annotation, legend in plot 1 and 2, all axis titles and text). Using a condensed typeface within my plots was nice because it allowed me to fit text more easily. I also think that it gave my visuals a more serious tone, especially since it was so thin that I had to bold it everywhere that I used it. I definetly spent more time selecting this typeface, and then I determined that Merriweather Sans was a good matching typeface for titles and captions of my plots. In Canva, I used the typeface Alike for most text, as it seemed both unique but still easy to read. I used Agrandir for my infographic title and other larger text in my infographic. Its a pretty basic typeface, but I couldn’t find anything that I liked better.\n\n\nGeneral design\nI definitely thought a lot about where I wanted my readers eyes to go. This is why I re-ordered factors so that the legends where in descending order in the first and third plot. I also re-ordered the factors my columns to be in descending order in my third plot. To avoid information overload in my first plot, I changed the name of many countries to empty strings. I also selected points to label carefully in my second plot for this reason. In addition, I also feel like I did a good job combining the plot and text elements in Canva so that the ideas flowed naturally using a visual hierarchy.\n\n\nContextualizing data\nAs previously mentioned, I used an annotation in my second plot to contextualize emissions to my audience. Recently, there have been a lot of news stories about the use of private jets among celebrities, so I felt like this was a good way to contextualize emissions, especially since the plot had to do with emissions per individual and flying a private jet is a very individualistic action. In my second plot, I also added the labels for other countries that weren’t the primary focus, like Venezuela, Congo, Mexico, and Bangladesh, as a way to provide more context for the emissions of countries around the world.\n\n\nCentering my primary message\nI think that the map that I included alongside the large text in the middle of my infographic was very effective at centering my message that there are some countries that have a disproportionately large amount of methane emissions relative to their population. Another point that I wanted to emphasize was how methane is mostly from fossil fuels, which is one reason why I put my treemap first. I also feel like the point I discussed in the second paragraph of text, right after my intro, emphasized this point by mentioning the 2021 study by McGill University scientists.\n\n\nConsidering accessibility\nI spent a great deal of time ensuring that the colors I chose were color-blind friendly using the “let’s get color blind” Chrome Extension. I tested using the simulate, daltonized, and simulate daltonized versions of Deuteranomaly, Protanomaly, and Tritanomaly. I also wrote alt text (embedded in images below) for all three of my plots (and my map) to ensure that blind users could still understand the figures in my infographic.\n\n\n\nTreemap (rectangle divided up into smaller rectangles) where each smaller rectangle represents anthropogenic methane emissions in 2021 from a specific country and sector (rectangles are colored by sector). Energy makes up 55% of global emissions, about half of which comes from the China, Russia, the U.S., Iran, and India. Agriculture makes up 29% of global emissions, waste makes up 14%, and 2% are from other sources.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of the world where six countries (Canada, the U.S., Brazil, Russia, China, and Australia) and the 27 countries of the European Union are highlighted.\n\n\n\n\n\nScatterplot of many countries showing 2021 population on the x-axis and 2021 per-capita methane emissions (in tons of CO2eq) on the y-axis. Canada, the U.S., Brazil, Russia, China, and Australia are labeled and emphasized. Australia and Russia are in the top left of the plot, with per-capita emissions around 300 tons CO2eq. Australia’s population is about 25 million people, while Russia’s is about 200 million. Canada is around 200 tons CO2 eq, right below a dashed line indicating the carbon footprint of a typical private jet flying for 48 hours. Canada’s population is around 35 million people. The U.S. is at around 150 tons CO2eq and has a population of about 300 million people. Brazil is at around 100 tons CO2eq and has a population of about 250 million people. China is at around 55 tons CO2eq and has a population of about 1,400 million (1.4 billion) people. Latley, the EU is at around 45 tons CO2eq and has a population of about 450 million people.\n\n\n\n\n\nBar graph with 7 vertical columns, where the height represents the total methane emissions in 2021 (measured in million tons of CO2eq). From left to right (aligns with highest to lowest total emissions), the 7 vertical columns are China, the U.S. Russia, Brazil, the EU, Canada, and Australia. China is at about 80,000 million tons CO2eq, the U.S. and Russia are both close to 45,000 tons CO2eq, Brazil and the EU are both around 20,000 tons CO2eq, and Canada and Australia are both less than 10,000 tons CO2eq. The 7 columns are each seperated into four colored components, one for each type of emissions source (energy, agriculture, waste, and other). Russia’s energy sector (85%) and Brazil’s agricultural sector (65%) stand out as particularly high. Emissions from energy in the EU (29%) and Brazil (16%) make up a relatively low share of their total emissions, compared to about 60 to 70% in China, the U.S., Canada, and Australia.\n\n\n\n\nApplying a lense of Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion (DEI)\nOne decision that I thought about through a DEI lense was the decision of which countries to highlight in my plots, as I had some leeway in these decisions. I wanted to ensure that I wasn’t being biased towards any specific country when excludeing or singling-out specific countries in my analysis. This was somewhat difficult when highlighting countries because I was kind of singling them out, but I tried my best to highlight many examples of countries around the world to avoid really placing the blame exclusively on a certain type of country."

This hyperparameter, called mtry, makes it so we don’t have to worry about the trees being correlated with one another because we are only looking at a randomized subset of the features at each split in each tree. Having these un-correlated trees allows us to build many trees that are also deep, without overfitting to the training data.

Boosted models are built sequentially, as each version of the model is fit to the residuals from the previous version.\nSGB models use a large number of shallow decision trees as a base learner. These early versions of the model, which are called “weak models” are improved sequentially based on the residuals of the previous version. At each sequential step, these weak models are improved using the sequential fitting algorithm of stochastic gradient descent, which uses random sampling of features to optimize the defined loss function (for this classification problem, we will look to optimize accuracy) for each iteration based on the defined learning rate. We start by tuning the learning rate, which specifies the extent to which we want to change our weak models at each iteration. If we choose to low of a learning rate, it may require too many iterations for our model to improve at all, but if we choose a learning rate that is too high, we may accidently skip over a better performing version of the model.\n\nBuild preliminary model & tune learning rate\n\n\nCode\n# specify model for tuning learning rate\nsgb_lr_spec &lt;- boost_tree(mode = \"classification\",\n                      engine = \"xgboost\",\n                      learn_rate = tune())\n\n# create tuning grid for learning rate\ntuning_grid &lt;- expand.grid(learn_rate = seq(0.0001, 0.3, length.out = 30))\n\n# create workflow for tuning learning rate\nsgb_lr_wf &lt;- workflow() %&gt;%\n  add_model(sgb_lr_spec) %&gt;%\n  add_recipe(tracks_recipe)\n\n# tune learning rate using CV\nsgb_lr_tune &lt;- tune_grid(sgb_lr_wf,\n                         resamples = cv_folds,\n                         grid = tuning_grid,\n                         metrics = metric_set(accuracy))\n\n# store optimized learning rate\nbest_lr &lt;- select_best(sgb_lr_tune)\n\n\n\n\nBuild preliminary model & tune tree parameters\n\n\nCode\n# specify model for tuning tree parameters\nsgb_tree_spec &lt;- boost_tree(learn_rate = best_lr$learn_rate, #

When using a single decision tree, there was a significant drop-off in accuracy, largely due to difficulty classifying songs that were in Maxwell’s collection."
