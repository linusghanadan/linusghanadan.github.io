I finished my undergraduate studies in 2023, receiving a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science & Policy from the University of Maryland. While at UMD, I also gained experiences working with the U.S. Department of Transportation, World Resources Institute, and The Nature Conservancy. Moving forward, my career goal is to implement data-driven solutions that advance sustainability within the public and private sectors."

The simplest way to define the are of interest to look for in the catalog are:\n\na GeoJSON-type dictionary with coordinates of the bounding box\nas a list [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] with the coordinate values definind the four corners of the bounding box.\n\nYou could also use a point, or some more complex polygon.\nIn this lesson we will look for NAIP scenes over Santa Barbara from 2018 to 2020. We’ll use the GeoJSON method: to define the area of interest:\n\n# temporal range of interest\n# CHECK: how to get open/close time ranges\ntime_range = \"2018-01-01/2023-01-01\"\n\n# NCEAS bounding

The simplest way to define the are of interest to look for in the catalog are:\n\na GeoJSON-type dictionary with coordinates of the bounding box\nas a list [xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax] with the coordinate values definind the four corners of the bounding box.\n\nYou could also use a point, or some more complex polygon.\nIn this lesson we will look for NAIP scenes over Santa Barbara from 2018 to 2020. We’ll use the GeoJSON method: to define the area of interest:\n\n\nCode\n# temporal range of interest\n# CHECK: how to get open/close time ranges\ntime_range = \"2018-01-01/2023-01-01\"\n\n# NCEAS

Lastley, we make another geopandas.GeoDataFrame that just contains a single point for Mount Whitney.

Located in the Sierra Nevada mountain range, Mount Whitney’s western slope and summit are located in Sequoia National Park, and the summit is also the southern terminus of the popular John Muir trail, which stretches over 200 miles from Yosemite Valley down to Mount Whitney.

Since these codes correspond to land cover classes specified in our class_names pandas.DataFrame, we need to merge the extracted codes and counts with class_names, which requires storing our codes and counts as a pandas.DataFrame.

To do this, we first extract the bounding box of lulc, which gives us four coordinate points that make up a rectangle denoting the area analyzed from our raster. In this case, we know that our raster area was a square, which means that extracting the bounding box does not include additional area that was not part of the analysis. Next, we convert these points into a shapely.Polygon, which then allows us to create a geopandas.GeoDataFrame containing this polygon. Lastley, we make another geopandas.GeoDataFrame that just contains a single point for Mount Whitney.
