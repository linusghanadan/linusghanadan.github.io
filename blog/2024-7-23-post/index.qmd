## Time series visual for [Deep Learning Project](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-7-16-post/ml_chesapeakebay.html) (created using Python)

**Context for plot**: In this deep learning project, I built and compared two deep learning models that predict phosphorus concentration in Chesapeake Bay tidal regions based on the time and location of sample. Specifically, my data includes 43,809 samples taken over 10 years (2010-2019) from 143 different monitoring stations across the tidal regions of the Chesapeake Bay. Created as  plot shown here shows monthly concentration over time, indicating distinct seasonal trends in the data.

**Caption**: Data exploration plot tracing monthly phosphorus concentration over time. This time series visual indicates distinct seasonal trends, with average concentration significantly higher during months in the summer and early fall seasons.

## Scatterplots for [Deep Learning Project](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-7-16-post/ml_chesapeakebay.html) (created using Python)

**Context for plot**: In this deep learning project, I built and compared two deep learning models that predict phosphorus concentration in Chesapeake Bay tidal regions based on the time and location of sample. Specifically, my data includes 43,809 nitrogen samples taken over 10 years (2010-2019) from 143 different monitoring stations across the tidal regions of the Chesapeake Bay.

**Caption**: From adding an additional 16-neuron dense layer with a ReLU activation function to our LSTM network architecture, we saw a **3.8%** decrease in MAE and a **1.6%** decrease in RMSE, suggesting that there are potential advantages from using a hybrid RNN-MLP model in this context. From these scatterplots of actual values and predicted values, it appears the reductions in MAE and RMSE can be attributed to **enhanced outlier detection** among actual concentration values >0.15 mg/L.

## Bar plot for [Geospatial Analysis Project](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2023-12-11-post/mt-whitney-land-cover.html) (created using Python)

**Context for plot**: In this project from my Geospatial Analysis class, I extracted land cover statistics for the area surrounding Mount Whitney in California. My data came from a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) raster dataset on land cover classification.

**Caption**: Of any one class, Mediterranean California Alpine Bedrock and Scree takes up the most land, constituting just over **15%** of the analysis area. California Central Valley and Southern Coastal Grassland, Sierra Nevada Subalpine Lodgepole Pine Forest and Woodland, and Mediterranean California Mesic Mixed Conifer Forest and Woodland each make up about **8-10%** of the area.

## Correlation Heatmap for [Ensemble Learning Project](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2024-4-3-post/dic-ml-models.html) (created using Python)

**Context for plot**: In this ensemble learning project, I built three different models that predict Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) content in water samples off the coast of California. The features being used to make these predictions were other ocean chemistry measurements that were also measured during water sampling.

**Caption**: Based on this correlation heatmap, the variables ‘Temperature_degC’ (correlation with ‘R_TEMP’ is 1) and ‘R_Nuts’ (correlation with ‘NH3uM’ is 1) were removed from the feature matrix due to high correlation with the target variable.

## Heatmap for [Geospatial Analysis Project](https://linusghanadan.github.io/blog/2023-12-13-post/phoenix_biodiversity.html) (created using Python)

**Context for plot**: For a project in my Geospatial Analysis class, I retrieved raster data of Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) from the Microsoft Planetary Computer catalog. This allowed me to calculate areas of interest based on changes in biodiversity and show my results on a heatmap.

**Caption**: The edges of certain areas in Phoenix, which had relatively high BII, decrease from **>0.75** to **<0.75**. In particular, this can be seen in the North East area of Phoenix, in addition to one spot in South Central Phoenix.
